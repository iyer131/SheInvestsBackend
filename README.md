SheInvests
Project Overview
SheInvests is a project aimed at empowering women who are not well-versed in managing their finances. By inputting their yearly income, users can receive personalized financial advice on how to allocate their income towards various aspects of their life, such as food, insurance, or vacation. Our backend, written in Python, processes these inputs and, based on researched statistics, provides recommendations on the appropriate portions of their income to be allocated to different categories.

InnovateHER Hackathon
SheInvests was developed as part of the InnovateHER hackathon, hosted by seven student organizations and the Purdue student government. InnovateHER is a 36-hour hackathon with a mission to create a welcoming and inclusive space for students of marginalized identities in technology. The event is dedicated to encouraging everyone to recognize and create solutions for issues faced by women, as well as celebrating their remarkable contributions to technology.

The hackathon aims to spotlight the challenges faced by women and non-binary people in technology. Itâ€™s evident that contemporary tech landscapes harbor gender-related challenges, especially regarding bias and underrepresentation. Through this event, we hope to encourage all students and promote active participation toward closing the gender gap in STEM.
